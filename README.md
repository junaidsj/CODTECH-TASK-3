# 🌼 Iris Species Classifier - End-to-End Data Science Project

This project was developed as part of the **CodTech Internship Task-3**, which required building a complete Data Science pipeline from data collection to model deployment.

## ✅ Project Highlights

- **Dataset**: Iris dataset from `sklearn.datasets`
- **Model**: RandomForestClassifier
- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebook with interactive UI using `ipywidgets`
- **Goal**: Predict the species of Iris flower based on petal and sepal measurements.

## 🧠 Steps Covered

### 1. 📥 Data Collection
- Loaded Iris dataset using `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`

### 2. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized feature relationships with `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
- Checked for missing values and data balance

### 3. 🧪 Model Training
- Split data into training and test sets
- Trained a `RandomForestClassifier`

### 4. ✅ Model Evaluation
- Evaluated with accuracy score and classification report

### 5. 💾 Model Serialization
- Saved the trained model using `pickle`

### 6. 🚀 Model Deployment (Simulated)
- Built an interactive UI with sliders using `ipywidgets`
- Predicts the Iris species in real-time within Jupyter Notebook
